Pokedex project with react native 

###AÃ‘ADIR FONTS 

1 Create a fonts directory in your project's root directory.
2 Place the custom font files (e.g., .ttf or .otf files) inside the fonts directory.
3 Create a react-native.config.js file in your project's root directory if it doesn't already exist.
4 In the react-native.config.js file, add the following code to specify the path of the fonts folder:
  this is inside of react-native.config.js
  module.exports = {
  assets: ['./fonts'],
};

5 Open a terminal and run the command npx react-native-asset to link the font assets to your project. This command will copy the font files to the respective native directories and make the required changes.
6 After running the command, you should see the font files in the android/app/src/main/assets/fonts directory for Android and the changes in the Info.plist file for iOS.
7 You can now use the custom fonts in your React Native components by specifying the fontFamily style attribute with the font's name. For example:

I DONT KNOW WHY, BUT USING STYLESHEET, IT DOESNT WORK, SO YOU HAVE TO USE INLINE STYLES LIKE <Text style= {{fontFamily: 'Pokemon'}}/>
